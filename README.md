# Heart Disease Classification Using Scikit-Learn

In this repository we try to predict whether a person has a heart disease or not by looking at patient records (13 features). This work was done following a Udemy tutorial [(Complete Data Science and Machine Learning Zero to Mastery)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery).

I further continue my own experimentation with the classification problem from where the tutorial left off in order to improve the model or find a better model.

## Data

The patient records used in this repository are taken from [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) from Kaggle.
